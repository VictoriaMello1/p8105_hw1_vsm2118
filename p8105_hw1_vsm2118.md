``` r
# Load the early_january_weather dataset
data("early_january_weather")
```

``` r
# Access dataset help file
?early_january_weather
```

The dataset “early_january_weather” has 15 variables total:

- origin (weather station)

- year, month, day, hour (time of recording)

- temp, dewp (temperature and dewpoint in F)

- humid (relative humidity)

- wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust (wind direction (in degrees), speed
  and gust speed (in mph))

- precip (precipitation in inches)

- pressure (sea level pressure in millibars)

- visib (visibility in miles)

- ftime_hour (date and hour of the recording)

The most important variables in this dataset for this analysis are temp,
humid, and time_hour. There are 358 rows and 15 columns in the dataset.
The mean temperature in the dataset is 39.5821229 degrees fahrenheit.

``` r
# Create the scatterplot
scatter_plot <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Time (Hour)", y = "Temperature", title = "Scatterplot of Temperature vs. Time (Hour)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Display the scatterplot
print(scatter_plot)
```

In the scatterplot we observe that during the month of January the
temperature at the beginning of the month was around 40 degrees
fahrenheit and sharply decreased to below 25 degrees. The temperature
fluctuates up and down as the days cycle through day and night. While
there are fluctuations, the temperature appears to follow a generally
increasing trend throughout the month until January 15th where there is
a peak temperature of around 60 degrees, followed by a sharp decline
down to about 35 degrees where the temperature remained for the rest of
the month. There was a notable period of high humidity, as shown by the
lighter blue data points on the scatterplot, which started around
January 10 and ended around the 15th. The humidity during the month of
January generally hovered around 40-60%, and the humidity was high on
the days where the temperature averages were higher with less wide
ranges.

# Problem 2

``` r
# Loading the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

# Create the data frame
my_data <- data.frame(
  numeric_var = rnorm(10),                   # Random sample from a standard Normal distribution
  logical_var = rnorm(10) > 0,              # Logical vector indicating whether elements are > 0
  character_var = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),  # Character vector
  factor_var = factor(rep(1:3, length.out = 10))  # Factor vector with 3 different levels
)
```

``` r
# Attempt to calculate the mean for each variable
mean_numeric <- mean(pull(my_data, numeric_var))
  print(mean_numeric)
```

    ## [1] 0.4712361

``` r
mean_logical <- mean(pull(my_data, logical_var))
  print(mean_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean_character <- mean(pull(my_data, character_var))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(my_data, character_var)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

``` r
  print(mean_character)
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean_factor <- mean(pull(my_data, factor_var))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(my_data, factor_var)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
  print(mean_factor)
```

    ## [1] NA

#### What works and what doesnt?

When taking the mean of the numeric and logical variables a numerical
result was returned, however the factor and character variables produced
warning messages when trying to take the means of the dataframe.
Athough, this is expected given that calculating means for character and
factor variables doesn’t make sense in the traditional statistical sense
because these variable types represent categorical data rather than
numeric.

``` r
# Applying as.numeric to the variables
numeric_logical <- as.numeric(my_data$logical_var)
numeric_character <- as.numeric(my_data$character_var)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
numeric_factor <- as.numeric(my_data$factor_var)
```

#### What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens when you try to take the mean?

For the Logical Variable as.numeric converted TRUE to 1 and FALSE to 0
as expected without any error messages. However, the character variable
resulted in a Warning message since as.numeric cannot directly convert
characters like “A” to numeric, so it returns NA. For the factor
variable, as.numeric attempted to convert factor levels to numeric, but
the resulting values may not represent the original data’s meaning,
resulting in the Warning message and leading to NA. This helps to
explain why taking the mean of non-numeric variables results in NA. It
is because R requires numeric values to complete a mean calculation, and
thus NA is returned when the data contains non-numeric values introduced
by coercion.
