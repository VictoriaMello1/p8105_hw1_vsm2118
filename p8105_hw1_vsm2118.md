In the scatterplot we observe that during the month of January the
temperature at the beginning of the month was around 40 degrees
fahrenheit and sharply decreased to below 25 degrees. While there are
fluctuations, the temperature appears to follow a generally increasing
trend throughout the month until January 15th where there is a peak
temperature of around 60 degrees, followed by a sharp decline down to
about 35 degrees where the temperature remained for the rest of the
month. There was a notable period of high humidity, as shown by the
lighter blue data points on the scatterplot, which started around
January 10 and ended around the 15th.

``` r
# Export the scatterplot as an image file (e.g., PNG) to your project directory
ggsave("scatterplot.png", plot = scatter_plot, width = 6, height = 4)
```
