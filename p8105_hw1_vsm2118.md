# Promblem 1

``` r
# Load the moderndive package
library(moderndive)

# Load the early_january_weather dataset
data("early_january_weather")
```

The `early_january_weather` dataset contains information about…

``` r
# Access dataset help file
?early_january_weather
```

``` r
# Variables in the dataset
names(early_january_weather)
```

    ##  [1] "origin"     "year"       "month"      "day"        "hour"      
    ##  [6] "temp"       "dewp"       "humid"      "wind_dir"   "wind_speed"
    ## [11] "wind_gust"  "precip"     "pressure"   "visib"      "time_hour"

``` r
# Size of the dataset (number of rows and columns)
nrow(early_january_weather)  # Number of rows
```

    ## [1] 358

``` r
ncol(early_january_weather)  # Number of columns
```

    ## [1] 15

``` r
# Mean temperature
mean_temp <- mean(early_january_weather$temp)
mean_temp
```

    ## [1] 39.58212

``` r
library(ggplot2)

# Create the scatterplot
scatter_plot <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Time Hour", y = "Temperature", title = "Scatterplot of Temperature vs. Time Hour") +
  theme_minimal()

# Display the scatterplot
print(scatter_plot)
```

In the scatterplot we observe that during the month of January the
temperature at the beginning of the month was around 40 degrees
fahrenheit and sharply decreased to below 25 degrees. While there are
fluctuations, the temperature appears to follow a generally increasing
trend throughout the month until January 15th where there is a peak
temperature of around 60 degrees, followed by a sharp decline down to
about 35 degrees where the temperature remained for the rest of the
month. There was a notable period of high humidity, as shown by the
lighter blue data points on the scatterplot, which started around
January 10 and ended around the 15th.

``` r
# Export the scatterplot as an image file (e.g., PNG) to your project directory
ggsave("scatterplot.png", plot = scatter_plot, width = 6, height = 4)
```

# Problem 2

# Loading the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

``` r
# Create the data frame
my_data <- data.frame(
  numeric_var = rnorm(10),                   # Random sample from a standard Normal distribution
  logical_var = rnorm(10) > 0,              # Logical vector indicating whether elements are > 0
  character_var = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),  # Character vector
  factor_var = factor(rep(1:3, length.out = 10))  # Factor vector with 3 different levels
)
```

``` r
# Attempt to calculate the mean for each variable
mean_numeric <- mean(pull(my_data, numeric_var))
mean_logical <- mean(pull(my_data, logical_var))
mean_character <- mean(pull(my_data, character_var))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(my_data, character_var)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_factor <- mean(pull(my_data, factor_var))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(my_data, factor_var)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

#### What works and what doesnt?

The factor and character variables produced warning messages when trying
to take the means of these variables in the dataframe. This is expected
given that calculating means for character and factor variables doesn’t
make sense in the traditional statistical sense because these variable
types represent categorical data rather than numeric.

``` r
# Applying as.numeric to the variables
numeric_logical <- as.numeric(my_data$logical_var)
numeric_character <- as.numeric(my_data$character_var)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
numeric_factor <- as.numeric(my_data$factor_var)
```

#### What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens when you try to take the mean?

For the Logical Variable as.numeric converted TRUE to 1 and FALSE to 0
as expected without any error messages. However, the character variable
resulted in a Warning message since as.numeric cannot directly convert
characters like “A” to numeric, so it returns NA. For the factor
variable, as.numeric attempted to convert factor levels to numeric, but
the resulting values may not represent the original data’s meaning,
resulting in the Warning message and leading to NA. This helps to
explain why taking the mean of non-numeric variables results in NA. It
is because R requires numeric values to complete a mean calculation, and
thus NA is returned when the data contains non-numeric values introduced
by coercion.
